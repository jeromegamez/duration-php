# Changelog

## 4.1 - 2020-04-26

* PHP 7.3.4 is now the minimum required version.
* `Duration` now extends `DateInterval` and can be used interchangeably.
* Objects having a `__toString()` method are now supported values.
* `Duration::toDateInterval()` is now deprecated.

## 4.0 - 2019-09-03

* PHP 7.3 is now the minimum required version.
* `0`, `null`, `false`, `true` are now supported values as in that they result in `Duration::none()` (`PT0S`).
* An `InvalidDuration` error will be thrown if a value is given without a unit or if the given value cannot be parsed. 
* `toIntervalSpec()` did more than it needed to do. Instead of formatting the current value the spec itself is now returned.
